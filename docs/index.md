# 2D Hydrodynamics Code

This project involves the development of a 2D hydrodynamics code for simulating fluid dynamics on a cylindrical grid. The code includes advanced numerical schemes such as 5th-order WENO reconstructions and handles a variety of boundary conditions. It is designed for high-resolution simulations, particularly useful in astrophysical contexts.
